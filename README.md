# splice_variant_search
Code for searching ONT long read RNAseq data for a splice variant of KCNMA1 for Paul Smith (UoN).

Long-read sequencing carried out by Simon Deacon, Matt Loose and Stuart Smith via DeepSeq.

Code uses the raw reads (fastq files) and the human genome and annotation GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic for splice variant analysis with FLAIR.
