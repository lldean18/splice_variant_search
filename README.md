# splice_variant_search
Code for searching ONT long read RNAseq data for a splice variant of KCNMA1 for Paul Smith (UoN).

Long-read sequencing carried out by Simon Deacon, Matt Loose and Stuart Smith via DeepSeq.

Code uses the raw reads (fastq files) and the human genome and annotation GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic for splice variant analysis with FLAIR.

Currently running for the SF188 (paediatric) cell line because this is the one Paul was most interested in but we also have data for various other adult glioblastoma cell lines that I can run through the same pipeline.

Running on all fastqs in the two fastq_pass directories in ds1239_SF188_DMSO_RNA
